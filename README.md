Hello!
There are five folders with my most recent codes on Python (projects are not older than 1 year).  
All tasks were performed as a part of studies at the university.
Folders:
  From 1st to 3rd: Symmetric Cryptography.
  From 4th to 5th: Teoritical Numerical Algorithms.
  
Each folder contains tasks, programm code and the results of research.
